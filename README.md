- We will concentrate our efforts to get a backend format, not caring about the human writability of the format. (we worry about the countainer first,  we will look later to ways we could have to fill the countainer.
- The next step is to compare our prototype based on jats4r with pandoc schema/requirements
- We also need to actively look to bring diversity in the group.

- We will concentrate our efforts on getting JATSxml outputs from yaml, via pandoc.
- First step is to list the information required for authors description
- We will meet again in a month, everybody will know he is welcome to have a beverage, like for example a beer.

![Here an overview of the plan, we will first work on a format allowing jatsxml export via pandoc (while keeping in mind it might be expanded, and grow from there.](figures/jams.png)

- Yaml must be  richer than simple jats entry, for example author byline may be best set via an additional entry, than via order in the yaml)
- We need to think : validator, usability in writing (netlify.cms)
